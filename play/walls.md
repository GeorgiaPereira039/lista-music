##Letras ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶


Will you forgive me
All of my fears
See through my scars and wounds
And my false beliefs
I will for once now
Clear the rust of my heart
I'll let you hold the light
That sees through my cards
These luxury shades now
May fall out of my eyes
True colours of love and hate
Cannot be disguised
To me, you're not roses
And I don't need your songs
Just be my escape and help me break these walls
And won't you let me break these walls? (Walls)
Reflections projecting my flaws (walls)
They're fighting back making me crawl (walls)
Those who don't try never know
And won't you let me break these walls? (Walls)
Reflections projecting my flaws (walls)
They're fighting back making me crawl (walls)
Those who don't try never know
Make you see through me
The mask of my smiles
Say that you love the random chords
That I have in my mind
In daylight show me tender places
That I don't have to know
At night be my destruction tool of war
When I face these walls
And won't you let me break these walls? (Walls)
Reflections projecting my flaws (walls)
They're fighting back making me crawl (walls)
Those who don't try never know
And won't you let me break these walls? (Walls)
Reflections projecting my flaws (walls)
They're fighting back making me crawl (walls)
Those who don't try never know
